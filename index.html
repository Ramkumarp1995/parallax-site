        <p> Thankyou for showing interest,
            here is a quick story of me and
            this website. My programming
            journey started in 2022,
            few months after I started
            to pursue a career in Web Development.
            I am currently in my first
            year and working hard to learn the ropes. I like
            coding all kind of problems
            from the very basic like adding
            numbers to the complex ones like
            competitive programming problems.
            I love making projects and games.
            Infact this website is one of my
            Web Development Projects which
            is built using HTML and CSS.
